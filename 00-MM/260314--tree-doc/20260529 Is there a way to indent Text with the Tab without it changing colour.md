This isn't a hypothetical need. It's happening right now at scale, because there's no standard indent syntax, and the most intuitive method (spaces/tab) is already taken by code blocks.

I've just started using Obsidian and I absolutely love it but I don't like the way tabs get displayed in viewing mode and was wondering if there is a way of just being able to indent text to make it more readable.

> I'm new to this as well and I just found a solution for a particular issue of mine that has to be with indentation. I just type $/quad$ at the beginning of a new paragraph and the first line is indented, it works with the immediate next paragraph and even if you add double space. Kinda like Microsoft office. You can also only use the space bar in the immediate next paragraph, without double space, and it would mark it as indented text, not like a code block, but would indent it in a block as well. Other solution is writing &nbsp four time before the next paragraph and in view mode it would be indented, this particular way is really messy tho.

Wanted to say, though, that you can escape as many space characters wherever you want by preceding each space with a slash. There's probably a more efficient way, as well. Four spaces would be \[slash\]\[space\] four times. \\ \\ \\ \\

In Obsidian, you can put LaTeX expressions between dollar signs to have them render as such. The term "quad" [apparently references](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/119068/meaning-of-quad) the Italian term "quadratone", which in old press machines was a type that didn't impress any ink on the page, so it would leave a blank space.

> That is just how it works in markdown.. If you indent a paragraph, it goes into code block mode (where the font is a mono type, and any markdown marks will not be rendered and will be displayed as is without any format) . If you really need to indent paragraph for readability, you need to use a bullet points, or numbered list like this:

> - para 1
> 	- (indented) para 2

> Anyway, I don't know why you need to indent a paragraph, but you may want to look at other "formatting options" in markdown like block quotes (stating your paragraph with a '>', you can then indent the next paragraph with a double '>>'), maybe how it rendered will meet how you want to look like

> Yeah, that bugged me right off the bat, too. I didn't change anything, just learned to live with not indenting like that. The color goes away if you don't put a line break / return before the indented text
