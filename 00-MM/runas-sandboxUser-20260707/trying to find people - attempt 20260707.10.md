// I am just a hobbyist

my dream project is to find a way to run VS Code and node.exe as a secondary Windows user account, so that if I accidentally install a malicious npm package, it can't access my main account's files 



I hope that AI assistants will be able to do many web searches  for me 

# desired output format from an AI assistant

10 quotes from webpages,
**containing the words "runas" and "/user:"**


# topic

I hope for quotes which contain the words "runas" and "/user:" and preferably "/savecred" 

// and ideally "code" or "node" or "npm"

... and where the secondary user is nonadmin!
// my secondary user is **less** privileged than the main user

... please don't give me any quotes with
> /user:administrator
> /user:admin

1. **Plain description of your actual goal** (best signal-to-noise so far):
   - `run program as different user for security`
   - `run VS Code or node.exe as a different Windows user account` 
   - `separate windows account to isolate untrusted app`

3. **The concept name used in security communities** (this is likely your best bet for Reddit/HN/blogs):
   - `compartmentalization` — this is the actual jargon word security-conscious people use for "isolate different activities under different identities so a compromise in one doesn't reach the others." Try `compartmentalization windows separate account` 

   - `poor man's sandbox windows account` — a phrase people genuinely use when they mean "I can't afford/don't want a VM, so I use a second Windows account instead"
   
   - `Sandboxie alternative separate user account` — Sandboxie is the best-known third-party tool for this exact goal; searches comparing it to "just use a second account" tend to surface real discussion threads with tradeoffs spelled out

4. **Site-specific tips:**
   - **Reddit**: search `site:reddit.com compartmentalization windows account` 
   - **Hacker News**: use `hn.algolia.com` directly and search `compartmentalization` or `qubes windows` — HN threads about Qubes OS (a Linux distro built entirely around this idea) often have comments discussing cheaper Windows-only approximations

   - **GitHub/Gist**: search code, not prose — try `runas savecred`

a note.. I admire Qubes OS, but it seems too heavyweight for my needs. 

// for years, I used many times:
- VMs
- containers
but they seem too heavyweight for my needs. 


I want to run a single Windows host, and then a second Windows account for untrusted apps. 

I want to be able to run VS Code, node.exe, and other dev tools in that second account, without giving them access to my main account's files or credentials.

many months ago, i experimented with  something like this:
runas code.exe /user:otheraccount 

and to my good surprise, the gui app seemed to work fine
